# MemoryTools
A collection of tools for working with process memory (with a specification for inner-process hacking)

I found myself re-writing a lot of a the same code over and over again, so I decided to create a library for personal
use, and release it here. 

This library contains various tools and utilities I use for inner-process hacking (i.e.) malware research, game hacking/reverse-engineering (single player only!), etc.

Currently only x86 Windows is supported, but I have plans for x64, and eventually linux compatability.
